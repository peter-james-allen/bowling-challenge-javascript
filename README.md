# Bowling Score-card

![](./img/index.png)

## About
This is a javascript bowling score card which allows users to track a game of ten-pin bowling. The score card allows users to enter the number of pins they knock over each roll and provides a running total of the score as the game progresses.

This challenge was to test my logic skills and was one of my first times using javascript.
